# OneTab-Night-Mode
Little theme for the onetab page to make it less eye raping.

Just downloaded the plugin and I see that the main page it creates is quite eye raping with no apparent option to fix this.
So I've gone and whipped up a little alternative theme they could create a toggle for.

I also hope that they will consider making their project open source on github so that people can suggest edits like this a bit easier.
