# OneTab-Night-Mode
Little theme for the onetab page to make it less eye raping.

##Installation:
**Windows**
1. Download the [onetab.css file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pullup/OneTab-Night-Mode/master/onetab.css) (right click --> "Save as..." or the easy install zip.
1. Drop / paste it into '<C:\Users\**YOUR_WINDOWS_USERNAME_HERE** (lol I know this probably won't actually make it bold, but worth a try, right? Gaurantee someone won't notice the text they need to replace)\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Extensions\chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall\1.18_0>'
  1. If that doesn't work, hit "Windowskey + R" then type '<%appdata>' this will usually put you in '<%\AppData\Roaming>', you now need to delete everything after "AppData\" in the navigation bar, then replace it with '<Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Extensions\chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall\1.18_0>' now you should be in a folder with the onetab.css. Just drag and drop the oneclass.css file that you downloaded into this folder and click the option to replace the file.
  1. or just download this handy dandy zip file, hit "Windows Key + R" type '<%appdata>', click back from '<%\AppData\Roaming>' to '<%\AppData>' (just click "AppData" in the navigation bar.) then just drag and drop the "Local" folder from the zip into empty space in the AppData folder. Now just click "Replace the file in this destination" and your installation is complete.

##Info:
Just downloaded the plugin and I see that the main page it creates is quite eye raping with no apparent option to fix this.
So I've gone and whipped up a little alternative theme they could create a toggle for.

I also hope that they will consider making their project open source on github so that people can suggest edits like this a bit easier.
